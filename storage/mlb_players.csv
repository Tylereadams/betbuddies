"Rank","Player","Team","Positions","Notes"
"1","Mike Trout","LAA","CF,DH","As long as Mike Trout continues to put up homers, 20+ steals, 100+ runs and bat .300 every season, you can bet he will be worth the first overall pick. Chances are, we have another decade of this consistent dominance."
"2","Mookie Betts","BOS","CF,RF","It may be tempting to snag Betts with the 1st pick over Trout, after the ridiculous season he just put together, but remember that he is just one year removed from batting .with 24 homers. There is a chance Betts outproduces Trout, but that isn't a risk you should gamble on."
"3","Jose Ramirez","CLE","2B,3B","Jose Ramirez may have been the best fantasy player in baseball last year, knocking homers with 34 steals, 110 runs and 105 RBIs, but he is still 1-C behind both Trout and Mookie Betts because of their consistent production over the last three seasons"
"4","Nolan Arenado","COL","3B","Arenado might not feel like the sexiest pick at this stage because he isn't the hot new name, nor is he a five-category star, but there is nothing wrong with boring old reliability. He has averaged homers, 125 RBIs and 100 runs while batting .297 over the last four seasons. Don't let him slip past this 5th pick in your drafts."
"5","J.D. Martinez","BOS","LF,RF,DH","It's funny how one healthy season can help you forget that a player missed games in three of the past four seasons. While Martinez has a legitimate shot at the Triple Crown, he is also a bit riskier than many of the other first round picks so proceed soberly."
"6","Max Scherzer","WSH","SP","Looking for wins, 220 innings and nearly 300 strikeouts? You can virtually lock it in with Scherzer. Not only that, be he has a 0.975 WHIP over the past six seasons. That is downright unfair. Don't hesitate to grab him late in the 1st round this year."
"7","Trea Turner","WSH","SS","Fantasy owners may have been disappointed with Turner's performance last year, but he still averages HR, 56 SB and 106 runs with a .289 average per 162 games. Only Rickey Henderson and Joe Morgan have matched those totals over a full season. Turner is an extraordinary fantasy baseball asset and well worth a top 15 pick"
"8","Christian Yelich","MIL","LF,CF,RF","There is no denying that Yelich was a first round value in and perhaps even the #1 fantasy asset thanks to a .326 average with 36 homers, 22 steals and 110+ runs and RBIs. These numbers blew away his career marks, however, so projection models all have him regressing to a high-end second round value this year"
"9","Ronald Acuna Jr.","ATL","LF,CF","Per plate apperance, Acuna was every bit as productive as consensus top-5 pick, Francisco Lindor, last season. Granted, Acuna doesn't qualify at shortstop, but that should tell you that the hype somehow hasn't driven him far enough up draft boards yet."
"10","Chris Sale","BOS","SP","There are a handful of starting pitchers that stand out above the rest, but Sale and Scherzer may belong in a tier of their own at this point. Sale posted an unfathomable 0.WHIP last season and 13.5 K/9. As long as he returns to health, we could be looking at a 340 Ks"
"11","Jacob deGrom","NYM","SP","deGrom was magical in and while there is a chance that continues into this season, we have to remember that the two prior seasons, he carried a 3.32 ERA with just 382 Ks and 22 wins. While that makes for a useful pitcher, the risk of him returning to that leaves him below Sale and Scherzer's tier"
"12","Bryce Harper","PHI","CF,RF","Harper may have posted just a .batting average in 2018, but the rest of his fantasy production was tremendous, plus his underlying metrics indicate the average returning closer to the .270 mark in 2019. His fantasy value improved when he signed with Philly because their ballpark is great for lefties, but he is still just a 2nd round pick."
"13","Jose Altuve","HOU","2B","It can be easy to be discouraged by Altuve ""only"" batting .with limited power and steals, but the injury seemed to influence his performance much more than most realize. You can expect a return to his 20 homer, 30 steal, 110 runs season with a batting average north of .330"
"14","Francisco Lindor","CLE","SS","Lindor kicked it up another notch in 2mashing 38 homers to go with 25 steals and his league-leading 129 runs. We can't bank on a repeat performance in 2019, but with even 80% of those numbers at shortstop, he'd return easy 1st round value."
"15","Alex Bregman","HOU","3B,SS","Bregman had extra-base hits last season to go with 105 runs and 103 RBIs despite being just 24 years old. Chances are high that his fantasy value continues to trend north. With that said, he is currently recovering from elbow surgery so be sure to keep an eye on his progress before picking him up in the 1st round this spring."
"16","Aaron Judge","NYY","RF,DH","Judge had a down year in which means his OPS was merely .919. If he can get back to playing 150 games this year, fantasy owners can bank on 45 homers, 110 runs and 100 RBIs. That may have you ready to grab him in the first round, but he comes with more injury risk than anyone else in the top 20"
"17","Manny Machado","SD","3B,SS","Regardless of what you think about Machado, he has been a reliable force of nature the last few years and likely hasn't even come into his prime yet. The landing spot in San Diego isn't quite what you would think, as it has actually been a top half of the league ballpark for right-handed hitters since they moved their fences in. So don't hesitate to snag him at the end of the first round, as he seems destined for another homer, 90+ RBI, 90+ run season"
"18","Trevor Story","COL","SS","You can snag Story in the late second, or even third round despite the fact that he outproduced top-five pick, Francisco Lindor in BA, SB, RBI and was just one behind him in homers. There is more risk with Story, but his campaign was among the all-time greats for fantasy shortstops"
"19","Giancarlo Stanton","NYY","LF,RF,DH","After obliterating pitchers in 2Stanton cooled off in a big way last year, striking out 211 times and hitting just .266 with 38 homers. There is upside for 60+ bombs this year, but believe it or not, he has only hit 40 or more once his entire career"
"20","Paul Goldschmidt","STL","1B","Goldschmidt was incredible over his last games, posting a .334/.424/.608 line. You may think his stats will take a big hit moving out of Chase Field, but with the humidor in place, it was actually among the worst park for hitters last season. In St. Louis, he should continue his run of 30+ homers, 95+ runs and a .290+ batting average"
"21","Freddie Freeman","ATL","1B","First basemen isn't as deep as it once was so commodities like Freeman are well worth investing in toward the middle of the third round. He is a lock for runs, 90 RBIs and a .300 batting average each year and that type of player doesn't grow on trees"
"22","Justin Verlander","HOU","SP","Verlander may be turning years old soon, but his velocity is still as impressive as ever and he 2018 was actually his best K% (34.8%, second best 28.1%) of his career while his BB%","","4.4% was his lowest. Don't avoid him because of his age. He is rocking better than ever before"
"23","Charlie Blackmon","COL","CF","While Blackmon wasn't the number one fantasy asset like in 2he still knocked 29 homers, led the league in runs and batted .291, and don't forget, that was a down year. If that is his floor, fantasy owners are getting a steal in the late 2nd round."
"24","Javier Baez","CHC","2B,3B,SS","Baez was excellent last year, hitting homers with 21 steals, 101 runs and a league-leading 111 RBIs. While he is surely a star, every projection model sees those numbers regressing in 2019, especially his batting average which was propped up by a .347 BABIP"
"25","Corey Kluber","CLE","SP","Each of the past five years, Kluber has given fantasy owners innings while compiling 1,228 strikeouts. In four of those five seasons, he has provided 18 or more wins. If you draft him in the second round, you can be certain to get a true ace"
"26","Andrew Benintendi","BOS","LF,CF","Benintendi is a spectacular real life player, but in fantasy, he was extremely similar to Jean Segura who happens to be going five rounds later. The arrow is pointing up for Benintendi, but not enough to warrant a top draft pick"
"27","Gerrit Cole","HOU","SP","You can look at Cole's 3.second half ERA and assume he got worse over the season, but all the underlying numbers suggest he was actually better. Don't shy away from him because of a false fear of his risk. Rather, expect another 250+ strikeouts with plenty of wins and excellent ratios"
"28","Kris Bryant","CHC","3B,RF","Bryant missed games last year and had his least efficient season of his career by quite a bit. There is some risk in drafting Bryant in the 3rd round, but he also comes with 40 homer upside, a batting average near .300 and both 100+ runs and RBIs"
"29","Anthony Rizzo","CHC","1B","Rizzo took a major step backwards in the first half last year, but his final line of homers, 101 RBIs and a .283 batting average ended up being about as good as his average season. We were drafting him in the 3rd round last year so don't hesitate to scoop him up for a discount this season"
"30","Aaron Nola","PHI","SP","Nola took another major leap forward last year, and while he may never be a or even 250 strikeout guy like the handful of pitchers being drafted above him, 220+ with a sub 1.00 WHIP and 2.50 ERA will certainly warrant a third round pick"
"31","Juan Soto","WSH","LF","Soto was every bit as good as top-ten pick, Alex Bregman per plate appearance last season, but is going picks later. Keep in mind, he accomplished that as a teenager. Don't hesitate to reach an entire round to grab him before he progresses even more"
"32","Blake Snell","TB","SP","Snell may have posted the single greatest second half of any pitcher in the last years with a 1.17 ERA, .155 BAA and 12.7 K/9. There is a chance he finishes as the #1 fantasy pitcher this season, but both Scherzer and Sale are safer bets because of their sustained reliability"
"33","Starling Marte","PIT","CF","Marte bounced back from his suspension season with another big year. He stolen 33 bases, knocked 20 homers and batted a quality .277. While he may not swipe 45 bags anymore, that power/speed combo makes him well worth a fourth round pick in standard leagues"
"34","Carlos Carrasco","CLE","SP","Although Cleveland doesn't pay him like it, Carrasco has been a true ace for five straight years, posting a sparkling 3.ERA with 193 Ks per season in that time. There is more upside with a pitcher like Syndergaard or Strasburg, but Carrasco's floor makes him one of the top 15 pitchers in this year's fantasy drafts"
"35","Trevor Bauer","CLE","SP","Prior to an injury in the second half, Bauer was among the top pitchers in baseball. He still struck out batters in 175 innings, but with health, those numbers could easily climb to 270 in 215 innings"
"36","Anthony Rendon","WSH","3B","Every single season, fantasy owners draft Rendon in the fourth or fifth round and every single year he outproduces that draft value. was no different, as he hit .308 with 24 homers, 92 RBIs and 88 runs scored in just 136 games. Don't make the mistake of letting him slip by you in the fourth again this season"
"37","Whit Merrifield","KC","1B,2B,CF,RF,DH","With the Royals not expected to compete in 2there is little doubt that Merrifield will surpass 40 stolen bases again. He doesn't have much in the way of power, nor will he score a load of runs in this offense, but the batting average should end up around .300 once again"
"38","Rhys Hoskins","PHI","1B,LF","Hoskins has plenty of power, as evidenced by his homers in just 728 career at-bats, but his career batting average now sits at .249. There will surely be plenty or runs and RBIs once again, but there isn't much value in grabbing him during any of the first five rounds."
"39","Khris Davis","OAK","LF,DH","Looking for homers? Draft Davis and write it in ink. He has knocked 133 over the last three seasons with 335 RBIs in that time. The floor is as high as you'll find in the first five rounds but the batting average is almost certainly going to be around .250 again"
"40","Noah Syndergaard","NYM","SP","Thor has elite stuff without a doubt, but the numbers haven't quite made it to the top tier of pitchers. Rather, he has just one season with strikeouts and has yet to win 15 games. You may argue that a Cy Young is right around the corner, but we've been saying that for three years now and it is starting to look like we have another Strasburg on our hands"
"41","Cody Bellinger","LAD","1B,CF","Last year was a major disappointment for Bellinger owners after he hit homers in just 132 rookie games in 2017. He still managed to hit 25 bombs with 14 steals, however, so the floor is plenty high. At just 23 years old, we clearly haven't seen the best of Bellinger so don't be surprised if he breaks out for 50 bombs this year or next"
"42","Xander Bogaerts","BOS","SS","Xander has been around for so long that it is easy to forget he is still just years old. Although there have been periods of disappointment in the past, Bogaerts still has averaged 15 homers, 91 runs, 84 RBIs and a .295 BA over the last four seasons. Add in that 2018 was his best yet and we may be looking at another big step forward this season"
"43","Carlos Correa","HOU","SS","Correa has missed a significant chunk of time in each of the past two seasons, and while he struggled in 2don't forget that he is still just 24 years old and one year removed from being the MVP front-runner prior to his injury. There is major upside here and he may prove to be a league winner"
"44","George Springer","HOU","CF,RF,DH","Springer is one of a handful of stars who started off their season with a rough patch. He started to turn in around in the second half before his injury, but only enough to get his final line to homers and a .265 batting average. If he can stay healthy, Springer might lead the AL in runs scored along with plenty of homers and RBIs, but the speed has essentially disappeared"
"45","Walker Buehler","LAD","SP","After tearing through the minors, Buehler pitcher pretty well for the Dodgers in the first half. Then a flip switched and he proceeded to become one of the top pitchers in baseball over the second half, posting a 2.ERA with 92 Ks and just a .165 BA allowed in 80 innings. Draft him accordingly"
"46","Joey Votto","CIN","1B","Votto did not return second round value or even close to it last year, but his ADP should be around the fifth this year. You can expect his batting average to bounceback above .and don't forget that he had 94 HRs in the previous three years before his 12 in 2018"
"47","Eugenio Suarez","CIN","3B","In the first half last year, Suarez was sensational, hitting homers with 71 RBIs while batting .312. The second half wasn't as pretty, so we may see him take a step back in 2019, but you can still bank on 30+ homers and around 100 RBIs with a decent batting average"
"48","Adalberto Mondesi","KC","2B,SS","If you pro-rate Mondesi's games to a full season, it comes out to 30 homers, 68 steals and 100 RBIs. I don't need to tell you that a season like that would put him above Mike Trout from a fantasy perspective. Granted, he is due for some regression, but don't hesitate to reach several rounds to get him on your roster."
"49","Lorenzo Cain","MIL","CF","In the past five years, Cain is one of only players averaging a .300 batting average, and among them, he is 2nd behind only Jose Altuve with 126 steals. There isn't much in the way of power, but you can bank on him contributing in all five categories with plenty of durablity."
"50","Jose Abreu","CWS","1B,DH","Since Abreu joined the league, he is fifth in the majors with RBIs and #1 among that group with a .295 batting average. As you know, he provides plenty of homers and runs as well. It may not feel interesting to draft Abreu, but with first base more shallow than years past, he is an excellent 6th round pick"
"51","Jean Segura","PHI","SS","It might not feel sexy drafting Segura, but you can expect a .batting average and 20+ steals for the fourth consecutive season from him. If he finally plays a full season, we may be looking at a 20/30 year with a .310 batting average which would make Segura a top 25 fantasy asset"
"52","James Paxton","NYY","SP","Paxton was excellent last year with a whopping Ks in just 160 innings, but this is also the first time he ever pitched above 140 innings. While the ceiling is clearly exciting with Paxton, re-injury is a significant risk, but he is moving from one of the best pitching parks in Seattle to one of the worst at Yankee Stadium."
"53","Ozzie Albies","ATL","2B","Albies is dripping with potential and there is no denying that after his homer first half with 9 steals. With that said, his second half was dreadful, batting .226 with just 4 bombs. There is a chance he returns first round value, but the downside would torch your team if he returns to second half form."
"54","Edwin Diaz","NYM","RP","There is a top tier of three or four closers, but among them, Diaz is likely the best. He racked up Ks in 73 innings last year, and while you can't bank on 57 saves again, 40 is well within question for a surprisingly good Mets team this year. His ratios will surely be stellar, but even so, with only 70 innings, they won't help you enough to warrant using a fifth or even earlier pick on him or any other closer."
"55","Tommy Pham","TB","LF,CF","Despite playing fewer games than Andrew Benintendi over the last two seasons, Pham has outplayed him from a fantasy perspective. Pham is being drafted four rounds later and is coming off one of the best second-halfs in the MLB"
"56","Patrick Corbin","WSH","SP","Corbin was an absolute monster last season, striking out batters with a 1.05 WHIP and 3.15 ERA. Granted, those ratios are likely to jump, perhaps even half a run in ERA, but he should also add considerably to his 11 wins from 2018 now that he is in Washington"
"57","Vladimir Guerrero Jr.","TOR","3B ","The always conservative Steamer projection model sees Vlad Jr. as a similar player to Nolan Arenado from the get-go with a .BA, 30 homers and both 100 RBIs and runs over a full season's at bats. This issue, however, will be whether he gets those at-bats. You can gamble on him as early as the 4th round, but it may not be early enough to beat others to the punch"
"58","Nelson Cruz","MIN","DH","Cruz has seen his batting average fall from .slowly down to .256 over the last four seasons, but the homers and RBIs are still firmly among the top of the league even despite his advanced again. You can rely on his durability and power in 2019 so don't hesitate to grab him in the 6th or 7th round."
"59","Stephen Strasburg","WSH","SP","There is a lot of appeal in drafting an upside pitcher like Strasburg, but keep in mind that he averages just innings over the last four years. Even with an excellent strikeout rate, that comes to just 174 Ks per season. The ratios will likely be golden again, but know that there is plenty of risk in spending a 5th or 6th round pick on him this year"
"60","Daniel Murphy","COL","1B,2B","Murphy's overall stat line wasn't all that impressive last year, but once he was healthy in the second half, he returned to hittin .with a 25 HR pace. Move that to Coors Field and we may be looking at the NL Batting Champion with plenty of homers, RBI and runs. Be mindful that he rarely plays a full season, but when he is on the field we are looking at a top 30 fantasy asset"
"61","Yasiel Puig","CIN","RF","Puig's career has been a bit of a disappointment, but even so, his last two seasons have been excellent. In that time, he has homers and 18 SB per 162 games. If he is able to stay healthy, we could be looking at a further breakout to 35 and 20 thanks to a major ballpark upgrade in Cincy this year."
"62","Marcell Ozuna","STL","LF","Ozuna may have taken a huge step back last year, but even so, he put up homers, 88 RBIs and a .280 batting average while playing with a significant shoulder injury. We don't know yet whether or not he will be ready to go on opening day, but assuming health, we might be closer to the 37 HR, 124 RBIs, and .312 BA we got from Ozuna in 2017."
"63","Corey Seager","LAD","SS","It can be easy to forget that as a rookie in 2Seager was not only the rookie of the year, but an MVP finalist. He was plenty useful in 2017 fantasy baseball too, but missed most of 2018 with Tommy John surgery and hip surgery. He should be ready to roll by opening day so while there is some risk, consider that he is still just 24 so we may not have seen his best yet"
"64","Eddie Rosario","MIN","LF","Rosario has been remarkably consistent the past two years with a .and .288 batting average, 27 and 24 homers, 78 and 77 RBIs and 9 and 8 steals. Expect much of the same from him again this season, making him worthy of a 6th round pick in standard leagues."
"65","Jack Flaherty","STL","SP","Flaherty was absurdly good last season as a rookie and seemed to improve as the year went on, striking out in 76 second half innings. With that said, his walk rate climbed to a dangerous 3.52 per nine innings by seasons end. He has the upside to strike out 240 batters, but there is some risk here as well"
"66","Zack Greinke","ARI","SP","Greinke's age is now and he did have a rough season three years ago, but besides then, he has been phenomenal since 2009. Expect plenty more of the same in 2019 with excellent ratios, about 15 wins and around 200 strikeouts. This makes him a top 20 starting pitcher for 2019 fantasy leagues"
"67","Justin Upton","LAA","LF,DH","Upton is one of the only players with at least homers in each of the last three seasons. You can also bank on 80+ RBIs and runs, and while his stolen bases have come down over the years, 10 is a good bet once again. Upton's batting average won't help you, but it should be enough to warrant a sixth round pick in standard leagues."
"68","Matt Carpenter","STL","1B,2B,3B","Over the last five years, Carpenter has a remarkable walks, which obviously has contributed to his 483 runs. In that time, his power has steadily improved, all the way to 36 homers last year, and while that total may not be repeatable, 30 homers with 100 runs makes him well worth a sixth round pick in 2019 fantasy leagues"
"69","Blake Treinen","OAK","RP","Treinen was magical last season, floating a 0.ERA and 0.834 WHIP to go with 100 Ks and 38 saves. That made him the number two fantasy closer behind only Edwin Diaz, and that is precisely how he should be drafted this year. With that said, no closer taken in the first five rounds ever returns enough value so be patient."
"70","Gleyber Torres","NYY","2B,SS","Torres isn't a big contributor in stolen bases, but he is plenty useful in each of the other four main categories. If you expand his rates out to a full season, Torres would have posted homers, 101 RBIs and a .271 batting average. You would be thrilled to get that type of production out of your seventh round shortstop."
"71","Jameson Taillon","PIT","SP","If you look at Taillon's second half, it may seem as though he broke out into an ace, but the underlying metrics tell a different story. Rather, he was propped up by a great deal of BABIP and HR/FB ratio luck. Most likely, he will continue to pitch like a good #3 this season for Pittsburgh."
"72","Luis Severino","NYY","SP","Over the past two seasons, only Scherzer, Sale, Verlander, deGrom and Kluber have a better ERA and more strikeouts than Severino, who is quickly becoming a true durable ace. He doesn't belong in that first tier, but may already lead the next group."
"73","J.T. Realmuto","PHI","C,1B","Realmuto's .batting average with 21 homers and 74 RBIs doesn't seem all that impressive, but the fact of the matter is that he blew the rest of the catcher scene away with those numbers. Realmuto is as safe as it comes at the position and should produce far above the lousy replacement level once again. This is especially true now that he has been traded to a great hitter's ballpark in Philly. Don't hesitate to reach for him so you don't get stuck with an awful catcher"
"74","Mitch Haniger","SEA","CF,RF","Although Haniger hasn't done it for as long as someone like Nelson Cruz or Justin Upton, he was better than both last year thanks to a .batting average on top of his 90+ runs, 90+ RBIs and power. Projection models are fond of him once again this year, but there is a bit more risk than the aforementioned annual powerhouses."
"75","Gary Sanchez","NYY","C,DH","There is no getting past the fact that Sanchez was a train wreck last season., batting .with only 18 homers. With that said, he is still just 26 years old and we are talking about the fastest player to ever reach 50 homers in the MLB. Chance are high that he will bounce back in the batting average department, and if he can stay healthy, bank on 25 to 40 homers making him well worth a 7th or 8th round pick."
"76","Clayton Kershaw","LAD","SP","For the first time in a decade, there is quite a bit of risk with drafting Kershaw. He hasn't pitched innings since 2015 and saw his strikeout rate plummet from 10.4 to 8.6 per nine innings. You can bank on top-notch ratios, but because of the innings a low strikeout totals and a potential shoulder injury, Kershaw has fallen into the third-tier of fantasy pitchers this year."
"77","Mike Clevinger","CLE","SP","After dominating in a smaller sample size, Clevinger took it up another notch in 2018, this time with 200 innings of proof. He might not win 16 games or strikeout 240 batters like some of the top tier aces, but his ratios and 200 Ks put him firmly in the 6th-8th rounds of this season's drafts"
"78","Kenley Jansen","LAD","RP","Jansen has been so good for so long that you might automatically assume him to be the top closer once again in 2but last year, he was nowhere close to it. Rather, his ERA plummeted to 3.01 with ""just"" 82 Ks. You can still grab him among the top tier, but you shouldn't even be considering taking him in the first five or six rounds."
"79","Jose Berrios","MIN","SP","There is a chance Berrios has another level of potential yet to be seen, but more likely, he has settled in as a third tier pitcher that will produce above average ratios with about strikeouts. That is perfectly sufficient for an 8th round pick. He may not have finished the season strong on paper, but his underlying metrics showed no reason for lingering concern."
"80","Nicholas Castellanos","DET","RF","Castellanos was a disappointment for so long that it may still be hanging over his stock. The fact of the matter, however, is that he has been great the past two season, hitting .with 49 homers and 190 RBIs. He only qualifies as an outfielder now, but should be regarded every bit as high as someone like Justin Upton or Mitch Haniger."
"81","Aroldis Chapman","NYY","RP","Chapman has been exceptional for nearly a decade now. It may surprise you to learn that he hasn't struck out batters since 2015, though. Edwin Diaz, meanwhile, had 123 last year to go with 25 more saves than Aroldis. Chapman is obviously one of the top closers in baseball still, but doesn't deserve any consideration as a top 50 fantasy pick."
"82","Justin Turner","LAD","3B","Batting average is difficult to come by after the first four or five rounds, but then there is Turner, who over the last five seasons, has racked up a .batting average which beats out plays like Trout, Yelich and Freeman. There isn't a ton in the way of homers or steals, but he won't hurt you in any category unless he deals with yet another injury. For that reason, he is a bit risky."
"83","David Dahl","COL","LF,CF,RF","There is plenty of reason to be excited about David Dahl, as his upside is a true five-category contributor. With that said, he has been among the most injury-prone players in baseball so even plate appearances is no guarantee."
"84","A.J. Pollock","LAD","CF","Prior to yet another injury, Pollock was among the best fantasy assets in baseball. He had homers, 9 steals and 38 RBIs through just 186 at bats. The ceiling for Pollock is a 30/20 player with a batting average near .300, but he has only played more than 115 games just twice in his career so don't forget about the risk in drafting him."
"85","Miguel Andujar","NYY","3B,DH","Andujar flew under the radar until his major breakout last season. We've seen players like that face major challenges in their sophomore campaign so beware of the risk associated with picking him, but as we've seen, the upside is tantalizing and may prove well worth a mid-round pick."
"86","Jesus Aguilar","MIL","1B","Aguilar is currently being drafted ahead of players like Scooter Gennett, Eddie Rosario, Justin Upton, Josh Donaldson, and A.J. Pollock. He may have put together a great first half, but once pitchers built a book on him, his last games saw him hit just .245 with 27 homers. His consensus projections aren't much higher, at 30 homers and a .258 batting average. You can find production like that off the waiver wire at first base, and while there is a chance he returns to first-half form, you may be better off waiting 170 picks and grabbing a similar player like C.J.

"87","Josh Donaldson","ATL","3B,DH","Over the last two years, Donaldson has missed half of his team's games, but he has still be exceptional when he plays, with homers, 101 RBIs and 95 runs in 165 games. If he is healthy, you've got a second round value, but that is a big if so proceed at your own risk."
"88","Scooter Gennett","CIN","2B","Over the last two years, Gennett has compiled homers, 190 RBIs and a .300 batting average. He may not be the most physically imposing ballplayer, but that is too large of a sample size to be a fluke. Don't hesitate to take advantage of the industry's lack of excitement over him."
"89","Matt Olson","OAK","1B","After lighting the world on fire as a rookie, Olson's small sample size didn't translate to the monster power numbers some were banking on in 2With that said, he still offers loads of power for a 10th round pick, and while the batting average isn't ideal, it won't kill you like Joey Gallo's."
"90","Joey Gallo","TEX","1B,LF,CF,RF","You may not love the idea of destroying your team's batting average with his .line, but you'll be hard-pressed to find 40 homers, and perhaps even 50 from anyone 50 picks early, let alone around the 9th round of drafts. If you combine him with Daniel Murphy in the 5th, you've got two players who combine for a .260 average with 65-70 homers. When you look at it that way, Gallo's value jumps off the page."
"91","Michael Conforto","NYM","LF,CF,RF","We've seen enough of Conforto by now to know that the hype was overblown. Sure, he has had some extremely promising stretches, but over a full year of health in 2he wasn't as good as Randal Grichuk who is going over 100 picks later because of the difference in name value."
"92","Wil Myers","SD","3B,LF,RF","Myers is commonly thought of as injury prone and last year's missed games certainly doesn't help. With that said, he averages 23 homers and 20 steals over the last three years even despite last year's disappointing season. There is major upside here even though his batting average is almost certain to stay under .260 again."
"93","Brad Hand","CLE","RP","Cleveland isn't as great as they've been in the past few years, but Hand should still get a load of save opportunities for the clear AL Central favorites. He now has three straight years with over saves and ERA under 3.00 so don't hesitate to snag him in the top 110 picks of your draft."
"94","Zack Wheeler","NYM","SP","Wheeler has had struggles staying on the field but even if we can get innings of the way he pitched to close the season, he would prove well worth a mid-round pick's investment. He may be the breakout ace that no one in the industry seems to be talking about this year."
"95","Roberto Osuna","HOU","RP","Osuna didn't accomplish much last year because of his legal issues and the time missed as a result, but he as still extremely efficient, driving a 2.ERA with a 0.97 WHIP. Assuming he stays on the field, you can bank on 30 saves and plenty of strikeouts on top of the strong ratios."
"96","Matt Chapman","OAK","3B","While it may be appealing to draft incredible real-life players, there is a major difference between fringe AL MVP candidate and top fantasy baseball player. Chapman's defensive prowess doesn't transfer over, unfortunately, so rather, we are looking at a mediocre power hitter with some batting average concerns."
"97","Andrew McCutchen","PHI","LF,RF","McCutchen might not be that first round pick he once was when we were getting homers, 20 steals and a .320 batting average, but he is still a plenty capable fantasy asset. He is as durable as they come and has managed 20+ homers in 8 straight seasons. Not only that. but he still steals double-digit bags per year and is moving into by far the best ballpark of his career so don't be surprised if we get a resurgence."
"98","David Price","BOS","SP","Price isn't going to thrill anyone as a workhorse ace anymore, but he still posts plenty of Ks to go with useful ratios each and every season. With Boston's lineup behind him, we can expect plenty of wins as well, making him one of the most appealing third-tier starting pitchers this year."
"99","Felipe Vazquez","PIT","RP","You may not expect the Pirates to be great, but Vasquez is durable and has no competition for saves. Lock him in for Ks, stellar ratios and enough save opportunities to warrant being selected as one of the top 10 closers in 2019."
"100","Craig Kimbrel","","RP ","Kimbrel still hasn't signed so wherever he plays will obviously impact his fantasy upside. Boston would offer plenty more save opportunities, of course, than somewhere like San Diego. You can bank on excellent ratios with nearly Ks regardless, however, so don't hesitate to grab him toward the end of the top tier of closers once again."
"101","Travis Shaw","MIL","1B,3B,2B","Shaw has back to back seasons with homers, and while his batting average may linger in the .240's again, that type of power is difficult to come by after pick 100, especially for someone who qualifies as a second basemen in most leagues."
"102","German Marquez","COL","SP",""
"103","Rougned Odor","TEX","2B,DH","Despite fewer games over the last three years, Odor has more homers than Javier Baez and is neck and neck with him in steals, runs and RBIs. There is a considerable difference in BA, but in terms of batted ball data, Baez was hardly above Odor in xBA last season so you may be getting a tremendous value in the 9th or 10th round of drafts this season."
"104","Robinson Cano","NYM","2B","Cano may be old, but he has not shown any signs of slowing down. In last year's shortened season, his production was still exceptional with a HR, 100 RBI, .303 BA pace. Not only that, but he may be the game's most durable player so don't hesitate to add him prior to his ADP just to make sure no one beats you to the punch."
"105","Jose Peraza","CIN","SS","Peraza broke out last season with homers, 23 steals and a .288 batting average. Whether or not the power stays is a question, but he seems to be a safe source for runs, steals and batting average in the middle of drafts."
"106","Victor Robles","WSH","RF","If Alex Reyes doesn't make the Cardinals' rotation, Robles is far and away the favorite to win NL Rookie of the Year. Robles is a true five-tool talent that is polished enough to be a top fantasy outfielder right away. The power may come a little later, but he will steal more than enough bases to warrant a mid-round pick."

"116","Jonathan Villar","BAL","2B,SS","Villar was a major disappointment in after being selected in the third, and even second round of fantasy drafts. As a result, he was an afterthought in 2018, and for the first half of the season, it was a good call. Once Villar was dealt to the Orioles, though, he took off. In those 54 games, he managed eight homers and 21 steals, which over a full season would have been 24 and 64, respectively. Think that type of production is impossible? Rewind to 2016 when he hit 19 with 62 steals and a .285 batting average. Villar still has that ceiling and you can get him in the middle of your drafts this year."
"117","Sean Doolittle","WSH","RP","Doolittle only had saves and 60 strikeouts last year, but he had an absurd 0.600 WHIP. That isn't a typo. With a full season, don't be surprised when Doolittle finishes in the elite tier of fantasy closers."
"118","Mike Moustakas","MIL","3B,DH","Moustakas has been an excellent source of power for several years running now and doesn't have as much swing and miss in his game as you might imagine. Now that he qualifies at second base and is back in Milwaukee, there is a strong case for drafting him within the top overall."
"119","Eloy Jimenez","CWS","LF,RF ","Jimenez may not be Vlad Jr. but most other years, he would be the consensus top fantasy prospect. His game is in the mold of Manny Ramirez where he could be a mainstay in the middle of a lineup, hitting homers with 100 RBIs and a .290 BA every year. That might not all come right away, but from the moment he is called up, you can expect a top 30 fantasy outfielder."
"120","Robbie Ray","ARI","SP","Ray took a big step backward last year in the ratios but still racked up Ks in just over 120 innings pitcher. There is still upside for an ace pitcher here and the floor may be about what we got last year which didn't kill anyone's championship hopes. He makes for a quality mid-round pick."
"121","Luis Castillo","CIN","SP","Castillo quickly became a darling of the analytics community last season but failed to meet the expectations of those who reached for him in fantasy. He is still plenty young and talented, however, so don't give up on him less the breakout comes a year later than everyone planned for."
"122","Rafael Devers","BOS","3B","If it weren't for Vlad Jr, Eloy Jimenez would be the top prospect in baseball. He is one month older than Devers, who has already compiled homers in 179 MLB games. He may have struggled last year, but let's not forget that when Alex Bregman was his age, he hadn't even been drafted yet. Devers is a former top prospect and while you may have been disappointed by his performance last year, that type of production is light years ahead of the best 21-year-old sluggers in the world."
"123","Max Muncy","LAD","1B,2B,3B","Muncy was 2nd in HR-rate among all MLB hitters last season. Granted, he slowed down toward the end of the year and his batting average wasn't ideal, but that type of power certainly warrants a top pick. This is especially the case when he qualifies at second base and third base too."

"128","Yu Darvish","CHC","SP",""
"129","Raisel Iglesias","CIN","RP","Iglesias has been one of the better closers over the past two seasons with saves and 172 Ks, but the Reds have been suggesting that he might not be the every day closer this year. The Ks and ratios would still be good enough to own even if he didn't get any saves, but this undoubtedly causes a hit in his overall fantasy value."
"130","Tim Anderson","CWS","SS","Anderson was remarkable in the first half but really slowed down to close the season. Even still, he managed homers and 26 steals. While he may be hard pressed to repeat that this year, 15 and 15 would make him a useful mid-round pick so long as his batting average doesn't plummet further."

"137","Yasmani Grandal","MIL","C","Grandal's batting average may not seem all that appealing in the .range, but that is actually at replacement-level for the position so he won't hurt you there. He will definitely help in HRs, RBIs and runs, though.

"145","Willson Contreras","CHC","C","Contreras was a major disappointment for fantasy owners in after starting off his career with 33 HRs, 109 RBIs and a .278 batting average through 629 at-bats in his first two years. He is still young, however, and expected to improve from last season."
"146","Yoan Moncada","CWS","2B","Moncada has both double-digit power and speed, but the batting average is lackluster. You can make the case that he has more potential as a former #1 overall prospect, but more likely, the holes in his game will prove too much for a big breakout to be a possibility."

He is right behind Francisco Lindor and Trevor Story, who are being drafted in the first and second rounds. Granted, the speed is a major difference but the batting average isn't at ..267 and .263. If DeJong can stay on the field this year, consensus projections like him to produce a very similar season to Carlos Correa who is being drafted 140 picks higher."

Meadows was once considered a future all-star, and while he likely won't venture into that territory any time soon, if at all, we are looking at someone who, even as a rookie, should hold a mediocre batting average while contributing in all four of the other roto categories."

Once he was traded to Tampa, however, Glasnow showed flashes of his true-ace stuff. In the second half, his walk rate plummeted and he surrendered just a .batting average. Perhaps more impressive is the fact that he struck out 11 hitters per nine innings, which is the same as Blake Snell and Patrick Corbin and better than Stephen Strasburg and Luis Severino.

"222","Alex Reyes","STL","SP","Believe it or not, Reyes should be ready to go out of Spring Training. You may be worried about Adam Wainwright beating him out for the #5 spot in the Cardinals' rotation, but they have made it clear that they want Reyes in the rotation. He has to be one of the favorites to win NL Rookie of the Year as he is polished and absolutely dominant."

"224","Tyler White","HOU","1B","White closed out the season on a terror for Houston, finishing with an .OPS. He likely will open the season as their DH and has a chance at breaking out, but may be pushed out of the lineup by Kyle Tucker if he slips up."
"225","Ketel Marte","ARI","2B,SS","We have seen enough from Marte to know he will never produce useful batting averages or the speed he teased as a prospect. There is something to be said for an everyday player in terms of counting stats, but outside of that, he is replacement-level."
"226","Trey Mancini","BAL","1B,LF","Mancini's batting average dropped points last year, but much of that was due to a rough BABIP. While he likely won't bounce-back up to the .290's his batting average likely won't kill you while he provides another 25 homers for fantasy owners."
"227","Gregory Polanco","PIT","RF",""
"228","Garrett Hampson","COL","2B,SS","The signing of Daniel Murphy should cause Hampson's ECR to drop another spots, as that transaction shifts Ryan McMahon over to second base. Hampson could force the Rockies hands with a strong Spring, but more than likely, he won't get the call until someone hits the DL. At that point, McMahon could slide over to first, third or the outfield. If it is Story that goes down, Hampson would fill the gap. He could eventually be a better version of D.J. LeMahieu offensively, posting a batting average near .300 with more power and speed. Right away, he will merely hold his own in the batting average department while contributing nearly 30 steals per 162 games."
"229","Chris Taylor","LAD","2B,SS,LF,CF","With the way the Dodgers' team is constructed, it is tough to tell whether Taylor will see another at-bats this year, but if he does, we are probably looking at 20 homers and double-digit steals to go with a decent batting average and plenty of runs."
"230","DJ LeMahieu","NYY","2B","With LeMahieu now away from Coors, you can't expect him to hit .again, or even .300. His stolen bases have essentially disappeared over the past few seasons and we aren't likely to get double-digit homers either. At this point, LeMahieu is a replacement level fantasy asset."
"231","Hunter Renfroe","SD","LF,RF",""
"232","Dellin Betances","NYY","RP","Betances is merely a closer in waiting, but besides Josh Hader, the best in the game. He is a sure bet for Ks, with upside ranging to nearly 130. Likewise, his ratios will be terrific each year and you can even rely on a handful of wins and saves too."
"233","Nick Senzel","CIN","3B ","Fantasy owners were disappointed to get nothing out of Senzel at the MLB level last year, but they shouldn't give up hope. Rather, barring another series of injuries, he will be with the big league club, weather in Cincy, Miami, San Diego or Cleveland","","pending potential trades rather quickly. He is a true five-tool player and could end up qualifying at 2B, 3B, SS and OF."
"234","Zack Godley","ARI","SP",""
"235","Jake Lamb","ARI","3B","You may not feel great about drafting Lamb after his trainwreck season, but he is just one year removed from 30 homers and 105 RBIs so don't sleep on him bouncing back. With that said, the move to the humidor in Arizona makes it seem as though his ceiling is a bit lower than what we saw from him in 2017."
"236","Maikel Franco","PHI","3B","Franco has always had plenty of potential, but has yet to put it together for a full season. Over his final at-bats last year, he was excellent and now that the Phillies bulked up their lineup, it is possible that Franco could break out for a .280, 25 homer, 100 RBI season."
"237","Miguel Sano","MIN","1B,3B,DH","Sano is out until at least May with a heel injury so he may not be worth drafting unless your league has DL spots available. If not, he is a great waiver wire pickup a few weeks into the season as his career per-profile is near identical to fifth round pick, Rhys Hoskins."

"240","Danny Jansen","TOR","C","Now that Martin was dealt to the Dodgers, Jansen is the favorite to start at catcher for the Blue Jays. He doesn't have much power, but his average will be quality and he should play enough that the RBIs and runs will make him a fringe top fantasy catcher."
"241","Alex Colome","CWS","RP","Although you may expect Herrera to be the closer battle in Chicago, some reports are suggesting that Colome has the upper-hand in the competition. This will be one to watch in spring training to see how it plays out. If Colome gets the job, he would be a top closer."
"242","Jesus Luzardo","OAK","SP ","Oakland's rotation is a total mystery. We may not see Luzardo until September, or he could even break camp as their ace. The fact of the matter is that this 21-year-old lefty will answer the bell when it is time. He was dominant last year in the minors, striking out in 109 innings with a 2.88 ERA and 1.088 WHIP. It was enough to cause his stock to soar from fringe top 100 prospect to fringe top 10. If it wasn't for Whitley in Houston, we'd be talking about Luzardo as perhaps the best pitcher in the minors."
"243","Ryan Zimmerman","WSH","1B","You may not feel sexy drafting Ryan Zimmerman, but he is just one year removed from hitting homers with a .303 batting average and 108 RBIs. Last year wasn't bad either with an .824 OPS, but he caught the injury bug again. He is a classic boom or bust late-round pick."
"244","Lourdes Gurriel Jr.","TOR","2B,SS","On a 162-game pace, Gurriel was a homer hitter with a .281 batting average and 87 RBIs. He may not keep up that pace with a full season's worth of at bats, but you can argue that is his upside which would make for an exceptional value late in drafts."
"245","Willy Adames","TB","2B,SS","Adames broke onto the scene last year as a 22-year-old posting a 19-homer, stolen base pace with a .278 batting average. It was a limited sample size, however, and there are still some holes in his swing. Think of him on the same terms as Dansby Swanson who also had a nice rookie campaign before everyone realized he had quite a bit to go offensively."
"246","Pedro Strop","CHC","RP","Brandon Morrow is technically the Cubs' closer, but it seems as though he will miss at least a month to open the season. That makes Strop the likely replacement and for one of the best teams in baseball. Don't be surprised if Morrow misses longer or even losses the job to Strop while he is on the IL."
"247","A.J. Minter","ATL","RP","Minter was supposed to be in the heat of the competition for saves in Atlanta, and while that may happen down the road, an injury setback for him has handed the job over to Vizcaino. Unless you play in a deeper league, this should make Minter undraftable, but worth keeping an eye on in free agency."
"248","Josh James","HOU","SP","Josh James went from one of the best sleepers in fantasy baseball this year to a draft and stash when news surfaced that he has a strained quad and is now out of the rotation battle. Chances are that he will start in the minor leagues and be called up the moment a spot in the rotation becomes available. From the moment it happens, he should be a top starter."
"249","Asdrubal Cabrera","TEX","2B,3B,SS","Now that Cabrera is with the Rangers and expected to play every day, we can feel comfortable grabbing him late in drafts as a reliable source of power to go with a decent batting average."
"250","Jose Martinez","STL","1B,RF","Martinez rakes, there is no doubt about that, but he also lost his path to playing time when Paul Goldschmidt was acquired this off-season. Now, he requires an injury to either Marcell Ozuna or Dexter Fowler/Tyler O'Neill to see more than at-bats."
"251","Seranthony Dominguez","PHI","SP,RP","The majority of Dominguez' appeal was ruined when the Phillies signed David Robertson, who will almost certainly be their closer. With that said, Dominguez should be a three-category monster and well worth owning even without the saves."

"253","Chris Paddack","SD","SP",""
"254","Brandon Morrow","CHC","RP","It sounds as though Morrow is going to miss the start of the season. That could very well turn into multiple months as we've seen with ""minor"" pitching injuries many times before.

"257","Evan Longoria","SF","3B","Longoria had a rough season for fantasy owners in 2but the batting average was held back by an abnormally low BABIP and his power was right on track for another 20 to 25 homers had he been healthy for the full season. In deeper leagues, his reliability is exactly what you should be targeting."
"258","Nick Markakis","ATL","RF",""
"259","Marwin Gonzalez","MIN","1B,2B,SS,LF","Outside of Marwin's huge season, he hasn't offered much from an offensive perspective. There is some power, but his batting average will hurt fantasy teams and the depth chart doesn't guarantee even 450 at-bats for him."
"260","Kevin Kiermaier","TB","CF",""
"261","Ian Happ","CHC","3B,LF,CF,RF","There isn't a direct path to consistent playing time in the Cubs lineup for Happ, but you can bet Maddon will find a way to get him nearly at-bats, and if one of their starters suffers an injury, Happ has an outside chance at 25 homers and 15 steals which would be an incredible value late into drafts."
"262","Manuel Margot","SD","CF",""
"263","Jed Lowrie","NYM","2B,3B","Lowrie gave fantasy owners a surprising boost in power last season in Oakland and always offers a decent batting average. He might start the season on the DL with a knee injury, but once he returns, Lowrie should be owned in every league."
"264","Pete Alonso","NYM","1B,DH ","Like Vlad Jr. and Eloy, Alonso's true impact will depend on whether on not the big league club makes space for him. As it stands now, Todd Frazier is likely to play first base with Jed Lowrie manning the other corner. It is possible that Alonso pushes the envelope in the spring, forcing Lowrie to shortstop, but more than likely, we are looking at his arrival coming when the first infielder heads to the DL. With an older group of players, that may be sooner than later. When he arrives, he will come with a dangerous stick right away and could be one of the stronger second half rookies. In the minors last year, Alonso swatted homers and drove in 119 runners in just 478 at-bats."
"265","Kyle Seager","SEA","3B ","Seager is starting the season on the DL after hand surgery and may miss the first six weeks. As a result, you may not want to draft him, but he should be in the back of your mind as a waiver wire pickup within a couple of weeks. He is a reliable source of power and shouldn't hurt you in batting average as much as we saw last year."
"266","Welington Castillo","CWS","C","Castillo only saw games worth of action last season, but his bat was still quality when he played. Over the last five years, he averages 26 homers with a .261 BA and 85 RBIs per 162 games, so now that he is starting, fantasy owners can expect useful production out of him."
"267","Shane Greene","DET","RP","Although Greene had a rough season, he comes into this year as the expected closer for Detroit. Joe Jimenez might take over before long, but as long as Greene continues to offer saves and strikeouts, he deserves a roster spot."
"268","Brandon Belt","SF","1B,LF","Belt still hasn't surpassed homers in any season and over the last two seasons, his batting average has dropped down below .255. If he can stay healthy for once, however, Belt may reach 25 homers if he keeps up his HR-rate."
"269","Starlin Castro","MIA","2B","Castro went from one of the best ballparks to the worst possible offensive ballpark last season and it showed in his stats as he dropped from a .batting average and 20 homer pace to 12 homers and just a .278 average. More than likely, that is the mediocre type of production fantasy owners will get this year."
"270","Adam Jones","ARI","CF,DH",""
"271","Matt Barnes","BOS","RP","There may be no other relief pitcher who is slipping under the radar as much as Barnes. Unless the Red Sox sign Craig Kimbrel, it seems as though Barnes will be the closer for a team that should win around games once again. Don't hesitate to grab him late if your draft happens before Kimbrel signs."
"272","Drew Steckenrider","MIA","RP","The Marlins likely won't win games, but even so, there will be saves to be found on the roster and Steckenrider is the early favorite to get the job done. How long the role stays his is anyone's guess, but saves are saves so add him late if you are desperate."
"273","Joey Wendle","TB","2B,LF","It is easy to look at a .batting average and assume a rookie will only get better. Wendle likely played over his head last year, though, and was a 28-year-old rookie. There is no power to his game, and while he may offer 15 to 20 steals, it won't be enough to make him anything more than a late-round pick."

"279","Yonder Alonso","CWS","1B","Alonso wasn't especially impressive last year with a .batting average and just 23 homers, but he is just one year removed from posting an .866 OPS with Oakland and Seattle so don't discount a big bounce-back campaign."
"280","Mike Zunino","TB","C","Zunino killed his fantasy teams in batting average last year, but he was up at .the year before so you'd have to think he will settle somewhere in between this year. When it comes with 20 homers and 50 RBIs at the catcher position, the batting average is much easier to swallow."
"281","Brian Anderson","MIA","3B,RF",""
"282","Jeimer Candelario","DET","3B","There is nothing sexy about drafting Candelario, but you can anticipate his batting average coming up points this year, as he was among the most unlucky hitters in that department last year. Along with that, fantasy owners should get around 20 homers from him."

He should see plenty of playing time in Arizona this year and qualifies at second base, driving up his value."
"285","Kelvin Herrera","CWS","RP","Herrera was presumably signed to close for the White Sox, but they also added Alex Colome who has closing experience. This one is too close to call for now so you may want to add both in a late round just to make sure you get some saves."

The reason, of course, is that virtually every game in that league is played in a Coors Field like offensive environment.
